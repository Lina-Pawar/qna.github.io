            <h2 style="text-align: center;">How to become a successful crime writer</h2><br>
            <p>British authors have always excelled in one genre in particular: that of crime fiction. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie for some are synonymous with the genre, attaining the same celebrity status as their fictional creations, the eponymous Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, respectively. In the creation of such memorable characters, these two authors raised the bar for future crime fiction writers. So how can you, too, write gripping fiction that also will stand the test of time? Here are some simple tips that will help you on your way and improve your chances of getting Into print.
            <p><br><b>Tip 1</b> The fiction world is awash with different types of crime novels. Before you put pen to paper, devour as many fiction novels as possible with varying sto-rylines. In this way you will learn how to create credible fictional characters and plots. Of course the make-or-break in any crime novel is the ending. Surprise revelations or an unexpected turn of events will delight readers. After all, even the experienced armchair detective likes to be kept guessing until the end.
            <p><br><b>Tip 2</b> We have established that a great cliffhanger of a novel Is the key ingredient to all crime novels. But how do we build up the suspense and throw the reader off the scent of the real culprit? Well, the answer is to use as many red herrings and subplots as possible without becoming too involved. The subplots and false clues should never obscure the main plot entirely; otherwise, the reader will become lost in all the intricacies and minutiae of the subplots.
            <p><br><b>Tip 3</b> It is important to establish your facts. If the setting of your novel Is In the past, beware of including modern-day devices or Inventions that did not exist at the time you are writing. Many a Hollywood blockbuster has been spoiled by anachronisms; the wearing of a watch in 'Gladiator' set in the Roman era is one such example. The same holds true for the written word.
            <p><br>If, on the other hand, you are using a contemporary setting then ensure you are fully knowledgeable of modern hi-tech detection methods and forensic techniques. Internet search engines such as Google will help you get your head around the most up-to-date procedures. Your research should Include:</p>
            </p><br>
            <ul><li>DNA analysis</li>
                <li>Forensic anthropology and pathology</li>
                <li>Forensic criminology, psychiatry and psychology</li>
                <li>Fingerprinting</li>
                <li>Interviewing techniques</li>
                <li>Computer forensics</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Tip 4</b> Don't lose the plot! Keep a track of not just your leading but also minor characters and their actions. It is important to have good continuity throughout. Whilst people may not be so rational or consistent in real life, your fictional creations need to have a certain level of consistency in their thoughts and actions, otherwise they may cease to maintain credibility with the reader. Sketching out a general overview of the plot before writing will also help to maintain structure to your novel.
            </p><br><p><b>Tip 5</b> Lacking Inspiration? They say truth is stranger than fiction so why not look to real-life events to inspire you? A rummage through a few local and national papers may uncover a potential storyline. After all, it worked for celebrated crime author Jeffrey Archer, so why not you? It goes without saying that a degree of fictional embellishment of real-life people is necessary to avoid being accused of libel and a sudden curtailing of an otherwise budding career.
            </p><br><p><b>Tip 6</b> Now you have written your best-selling novel all you need to do is find a publisher! Again, research on the internet will reveal a list of publishers most likely to publish your literary genre. Should you fail to find a publisher keep trying. After all, some of the most celebrated authors were initially turned down on their first attempt!
